# The Docker & Container Ebook Series

Welcome to this special Github preview edition of The New Stack's Docker & Container Ebook Series. 

Thanks in advance for taking the time to review a few [select chapters](CONTENTS.md) from our upcoming series of ebooks about Docker and the container ecosystem. 

The five-book series aims to map the vast and rapidly expanding oceans of the container universe, and will cover:

* Understanding the Docker & Container Ecosystem

* Application Development and Microservices

* Automation and Orchestration

* Networking, Security and Storage

* Management and Monitoring

This preview [contains sample chapters](CONTENTS.md) from across the series--three from the first book, and one each from the second and third. 

We are hoping youâ€™ll be so kind as to share your suggestions or feedback with us. Feel free to send us a pull request, or share them directly with us [by email](mailto:%20ebooks@thenewstack.io).

We would be remiss if we didn't thank our series sponsors:
